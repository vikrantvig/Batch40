Answer:- Since DB POD is deleted thats why DB socket connection from Application to DB is not available hence data is not available

WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop?
Answer:- Since DB pod is created and APP was still connected to previoud DB Socket, so we need to restart that App POD(result app PDO) to reconnect to DB. Post 
restart it starts working but data previously stroed in DB is lost sicne DB pod is recreated and data is lost
